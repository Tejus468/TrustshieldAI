# 🛡️ TrustShield AI

TrustShield AI is an AI-powered phishing email detection system designed to identify malicious emails using a multi-layered detection approach. The system combines machine learning, URL intelligence, rule-based analysis, behavioral analysis, emotional analysis, and explainable AI to provide accurate phishing detection along with clear, human-readable explanations.

## 🚀 Features

- 📧 Phishing email detection
- 🤖 Machine learning-based classification
- 🔗 URL intelligence and suspicious link analysis
- 📋 Rule-based phishing pattern detection
- 😊 Emotional and urgency analysis
- 🧠 Explainable AI for detection reasoning
- 🌐 Chrome Extension integration
- 📊 SOC Dashboard for monitoring
- 🗄️ MongoDB database for storing analysis results
- ⚡ Fast backend using Flask and asynchronous processing

## 🚀 Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TrustShield-AI.git
cd TrustShield-AI
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure MongoDB

Start MongoDB locally and update the database connection string in the backend configuration.

### Run the backend

```bash
python app.py
```

or

```bash
flask run
```

### Load the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the `chrome-extension` folder.

## 📊 Workflow

1. User opens an email.
2. Chrome Extension extracts email content.
3. Backend receives the request.
4. Multiple detection layers execute in parallel.
5. Scores are aggregated into a trust score.
6. Explainable AI generates the reason for the prediction.
7. Results are stored in MongoDB.
8. Detection result is displayed to the user.

## 📈 Performance

| Scenario | Detection Rate | Latency |
|----------|---------------:|--------:|
| Standard Spam | ~98% | <150 ms |
| Spear Phishing | ~95% | <200 ms |
| Burst Attacks | ≥90% | <220 ms |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Advanced NLP models (BERT/LLMs)
- Real-time threat intelligence integration
